# OTP AND PASSWORD GENERATION USING CORE JAVA
A one-time password (OTP) is a password that is valid for only one login session or
transaction, on a computer system or other digital device. OTPs are widely used in websites like- Facebook, Google Sign-in, Wifi â€“ accessing,
Railways Portal Login etc.
it is a great possibility that they uses the same algorithm as an OTP is generated. It is very rare the unique string generated is already been generated before
and has been associated with a different code then another random string is used. 
OTPs are way more secure
than static passwords

The code randomly pick characters from our all possibilities and generate a string of the
desired length from it. OTPs are generally 6-7 characters long and randomness in 6-7
characters almost guarantees a secure way of logging in.
